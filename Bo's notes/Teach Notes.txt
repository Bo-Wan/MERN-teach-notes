Priorities:
reintroduce JS: object / properties / methods
student use constructor
student use user input + constructor => create object (node call method from instance)

Procedure:
2.1: Instructor - welcome (5m)
 - Welcome!!! Today is going to be really fun! Constructors! Make our code more dynamic.
    - insert "programmers are lazy" theory. Do less with more. Be lazy, code neat.
 - you already know how object function, that's good!
 - Let's quickly go over object basics to begin!
    - warm up: create and use an object
 - main activity: 4 exercises
 - extra: prototypes

2.2: Students - cats and dogs (15m)
student follow instruction:
 - Make dog object with 3 keys: raining = true / noise is woof! / make noise = output noise if raining
 - Make cat object with 3 keys: raining = false / noise is meow / make noise = output noise if raining
 - Make dog bark
 - Make cat meow
 - Bonus: massHysteria funtion: input = dog, cat; output = "massHysteria" if both rainings are true
 - Bonus: simplify code

2.3: Everyone - cats and dogs demo (10m)
Everyone mode:
 - I open code editor
 - Call students one by one to complete code with me while explaining
 - Run the code and explain line by line

 - finished code = 01

 - explain:
    - where we create keys / methods
    - how do we use them in the future

 - Ask: how to remove redanduncy
 - Think: what's not right? dog n cat is so similar. Only diff is data.
 - Any foolproof way to remove the redandency?
    - tada! Constructors!
    - prototypes... yes. but it's extra / optional topic. We don't use it as often so let's see if we get a chance to go back to it

2.4: Instructor: cats n dogs - together (15m)
